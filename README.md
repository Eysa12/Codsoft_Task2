## Movie Rating Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can analyze different features of movies (such as genre, budget, cast, etc.) and predict their rating with good accuracy. Such a system can help users make better viewing decisions and assist platforms in recommending movies.

🚀 Objectives

Collect and preprocess movie-related data</br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</br>
Apply feature engineering and selection techniques</br>
Train different machine learning models for prediction</br>
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics</br>
